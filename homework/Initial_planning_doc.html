                <h1> Jossten Child's Peer Review</h1>
                    <p>Good job man, I especially liked your wire frames. Very professional. Did you use Photoshop or something like that.</p>

                    <h2>A few recommendations:</h2>

                    <h3>Purpose Statement</h3>
<p>I really liked how concise your statement is. Good elevator pitch length. My only suggestion is that you include a little more information regarding how you will be accomplishing the goals outlined in your current purpose statement.</p>

                    <h3>Target Audience</h3>
<p>You'll probably want to be more specific here. Maybe include some demographic information such as the age and education level. Even better, list a little information on how your website will most likely be viewed (mobile, desktop etc.). This will help you narrow down who you are truly developing for, and to which format you should dedicate the majority of your energies. Check out last weeks mobile assessment assignment for more info. I especially recommend checking out the "Less is More" article. Really cool to keep in mind when developing a target audience.<p>

                    <h3>Persona</h3>
<p>Nice in depth analysis. Phil seems like a pretty cool guy, and you covered your bases as far as making him seem like a human being who could actually exist. My only recommendation is that you format it a little so that the various elements of your persona are a little more segregated and easy to read. You could do this with headers and paragraphs, or even a basic HTML table if you had the chance.</p>

                    <h3>Sketch</h3>
<p>Wow, aces on the sketch design, super professional. I'm still curious as to what program you used to make those awesome templates. I also liked how you sourced your own more real world templates to make the sketches seem more relevant. Just one recommendation: try applying a "width" modifier to your images so that they fit a little better on smaller screens (I'm rocking a 12 inch screen here, and the photos are getting a little cut off).</p>
                <h3>What I did because of his advice:</h3>
                    <p> To start I made my purpose statment more specific so that it would show more meaning and the point for creating my site. I also added headings in the target audience section and resized my sketches to fit the screen.</p>
