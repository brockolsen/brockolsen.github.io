           <p><strong>Web Pages</strong></p>
            
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Home page-</strong> Most items will be accessible from the home screen. It will display information clearly and with proper proximity.

This page gives an intro into why an event planning service will be beneficial to you. It features a Christmas image because it is currently the Holliday season. And business always spikes this time of year with family get-togethers and work parties. The header will display a silver bar with Johnson Design written inside it and a logo to the right, navigation will have links to all the other pages (Index, Venues, Catering, Contact Us, About Us Pages), and footer will have links to this document and my homework page from CIT 230 this semester and will be the same as the other pages.</li>

                <li><strong>Venues-</strong> In this page consumers will help clients generate ideas on locations that work best for their specific event. A list will be displayed with various locations around eastern Idaho. It will also have pictures for venues we have done in the past. The first item on the venue list will include weddings with a featured image of a wedding setup with white tables. A description will tell visitors of past weddings we have done and will let users know we will take care of their needs.

Lastly a birthday party will be featured. The image will be full of balloons! And have a happy description for all ages both old and young. The header, navigation, and footer will be the same as the other pages.</li>

                <li><strong>Catering-</strong>this page will show a few ideas from past events as well as options that we could provide catering services for such as deserts or meals. Many options will be listed such as full course meals, light snacks, desert bars, and our featured cakes and pastries. The header, navigation, and footer will be the same as the other pages.</li>

                <li><strong>Contact Us-</strong> This page is right at the heart of the site. Our goal is to have Perspective clients fill out the form on this page. By doing this they provide us with key information on how to help them best. Information will include a name, phone number, email, event type and a message describing the future event with any questions had. The header, navigation, and footer will be the same as the other pages.</li>

                <li><strong>About Us-</strong> This page is incredibly important. It will show the site visitors that we are real people. It is designed with the intent on connecting with those that visit the site. Our employees will have a picture and a short bio. Telling about themselves.

            <img src="/event_project/Wireframes/largewire.png" alt="Larframe" width="1000px">

			<p>
				The goal in creating this large wireframe is to create a guide to use while building the site. It will allow users to be in control and access information easily. It was created to be simple and to the point allowing many users to easily understand and navigate the site. </p>
            
            <img src="/event_project/Wireframes/smlnmedwire.png" alt="smalmedframe" width="1000px">

			<p>
				The medium size screen allows basic information to be displayed without lots of clutter and navigation difficulty. It is similar to a large display without unnecessary detail being displayed.
The small screen displays even less information but has effective use of navigation to allow users to access the material needed.
 </p>

            
            <p><strong>Usability Concepts</strong></p>
            <p>The font size will be large but easily viewable on a mobile screen. The tags on images and other objects of the page will have multiple defining key words to allow it to be found with ease in search engines. The links will be easily viewable and display well with the background color.</p>

            
            
           <p><strong> Java Script Files:</strong></p>
<p>Java Script will be used in the contact us page on the form and in the video on the home page.</p>
