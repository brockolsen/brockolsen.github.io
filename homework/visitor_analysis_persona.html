                    <h2>Site Contrast</h2>
                    <p>URL: www.arngren.com</p>
                <p>this website is cluttered and hard to locate the items the user is looking for. Arngren.net is not a good example of using proximity. The links and pictures need to have better spacing and more organization. it is hard to know what the website is acualy about when items on the page are not grouped properly.</p>
